This project simulates and compares the functionality of software-defined networking (SDN) switches versus traditional hubs, while exploring key networking protocols like ARP, ICMP, and Neighbor Discovery (ND). It also includes an OSPF routing simulation to demonstrate dynamic routing capabilities and a performance comparison between normal TCP and TCP Tahoe. Through these simulations, the project provides a comprehensive understanding of network behavior, protocol operations, and routing mechanisms, highlighting the efficiency and use cases of different networking technologies and protocols.
